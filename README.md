# Hyperbolic Origami 2-Torus Visualizer

This repository contains accompanying programs that visualizes the two approximating embeddings of hyperbolic 2-tori in the Klein model of hyperbolic 3-space. The results can be found from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18668) "Vertex-minimal hyperbolic origami 2-torus."

The 10-vertex model achieves the minimal number of vertices required to triangulate a 2-torus. The 12-vertex model comes from a 7-regular triangulation and has a 2-fold rotational symmetry around the z-axis that is a hyperelliptic involution. One can group the 12 vertices into six pairs, and the hyperellptic involution acts by transpositions on each of the six pairs, fixing the midpoint of the edges connecting each pair of vertices.
